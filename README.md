# CPython example

Cpython learning examples, let's speed up your Python speed 10000 times!

- CMakeLists.txt ------ Compile the file, you should pay attention to your own Python dependency directory
- example ------ Examples of C++ accelerating Python

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| example/P0 | Use GCC to compile C file as so / DLL library and load it with ctypes in Python |
| example/P1 | Run Python code in C++, such as: ` import numpy !`           |
| example/P2 | Using Python's data structures in C++                        |
| example/P3 | Compile / export the C++ code into modules and directly let ` Python import it! ` |
| example/P4 | For the same cumulative function, the implementation of importing C++ into Python is 10000 times faster than that of Python itself |
| example/P5 | C++ returns a bunch of messy arrays for Python to receive    |
